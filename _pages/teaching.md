# Movement analysis

I am involved in running practical lab demonstrations for movement analysis education using inertial-based movement sensors in a laboratory environment as well as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements. I have also held a number of lectures and seminars on neuroimaging during movement as well as fNIRS methodology in general.

# fNIRS course

Our research group runs an fNIRS course on doctoral level which I am involved in, *H1F6004, Imaging in Neuroscience: with a Focus on Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy*.
